Simple script to visualize data for sturgeon spwaning over time at different receiver locations. Made for MATE ROV competition.

Conext: In the MATE ROV competition, once an acoustic receiver (represented by a PVC pipe) is retrived by the ROV from a sturgeon spawning site, the judge will provide a data file (CSV) on the concentration of "sturgeon" over the past 5 days. Correctly plotting and noting which site has highest potential will earn 20 points.

Skip the second cell if you have pre-existing data to load.The first cell provides some example data to check out the script.
